# Use of generative AI in this project

*Last reviewed: 2026-11-12. Maintainer: Michael S. Zens.*

This statement describes how a generative AI assistant (Anthropic’s
Claude, used through the Claude Code command-line tool) has been used in
developing the curveR packages and the I-SPI application, and how its
output is checked. It follows the principle that a project should say
plainly what AI did, what people did, and who is accountable.

## Summary

|  |  |
|----|----|
| **Tool** | Claude (Anthropic) via Claude Code; model versions are recorded in the working notes, not in commits |
| **Where it was used** | \(1\) refining the user interfaces of I-SPI; (2) reviewing and checking the integrity of the statistical analysis that processes assay responses (calibration curves, precision weights, censoring); (3) drafting code, tests and documentation under direction |
| **Where it was not used** | choosing scientific questions or study designs; interpreting results for any publication; handling participant-level data outside the access controls of the institution |
| **Accountability** | The maintainer reviews and is responsible for every change that is merged. AI is not an author of the software or of any analysis |

## What the assistant did

- **User interface refinement (I-SPI).** Proposed and implemented
  layout, labelling, help text and navigation changes in the Shiny
  application, which the maintainer reviewed in the running application.
- **Statistical integrity review.** Re-derived and challenged the
  variance models used to weight assay measurements, for example the
  move from a multiplicative to an additive measurement-error model, the
  treatment of censored (out-of-range) samples, and the handling of
  dilution scales. Findings were checked by simulation with known true
  values and are kept as automated tests (`tests/testthat`).
- **Engineering.** Wrote code, database migrations, tests and
  documentation (vignettes, glossary, data dictionary) from instructions
  given by the maintainer.

## What people did

- Set the scientific goals and requirements, for instance that existing
  behaviour and the existing test suite must remain unchanged, and that
  a new statistical model is opt-in until it has been validated.
- Decided which statistical approach to adopt and which results to
  trust.
- Reviewed all diffs, approved every commit, release and database
  change, and operated the deployed systems.
- Hold all credentials. The assistant works with a restricted set of
  permissions and does not store secrets in repositories.

## How output is verified

1.  **Automated tests.** The unit tests of each package, including tests
    that pin pre-existing behaviour, must pass unmodified before a
    change is merged.
2.  **Simulation with ground truth.** Statistical claims are checked on
    simulated data where the true answer is known (for example,
    recovering a known group difference, bias of weighted versus
    unweighted means).
3.  **End-to-end checks on disposable infrastructure.** Database changes
    are rehearsed on a throwaway database; a snapshot of the affected
    rows is taken before any overwrite, and a rollback path exists.
4.  **Independent package checks.** `R CMD check` with no errors or
    warnings before each release.
5.  **Human review.** Nothing reaches the public repositories or the
    deployed application without the maintainer approving it.

Assistant output can be wrong in plausible-sounding ways. Where the
documentation makes a numerical claim, the number is produced by code in
the same document.

## Data and privacy

The assistant runs on the maintainer’s workstation and can read the
files and database queries the maintainer permits during a session;
content it reads is processed by the AI provider’s service. The
maintainer limits that access to what the task needs and applies the
institution’s rules for research data. Exports that contain patient
identifiers (for example weight snapshots taken before a database
change) are stored outside the repositories, and credentials are kept in
files that are excluded from version control.

## Reproducibility and provenance

Release notes and the git history record what changed and when. The
packages’ `NEWS.md` files list each change. Commits are authored by the
maintainer and do not carry an AI co-author trailer; this document is
the project’s disclosure instead.
